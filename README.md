### DataKit™ by DataKind

## What's a DataKit?
A DataKit™ is a work-ready set of data, software, and innovation questions, curated by DataKind, in a domain of social good. As you engage with a DataKit, you will apply your skills for social impact while deepening your understanding of problems common in the space. All learnings, ideas, and insights resulting from this DataKit will be aggregated and used by DataKind to expand our impact in the financial inclusion and economic opportunity sector. Specifically, we aim to leverage your insights and prototype solutions to expand on our product offerings, supporting stakeholders to expand their reach and impact. Learnings will be shared throughout the DataKit and beyond. 

## DataKind’s Work in Financial Inclusion and Economic Opportunity
Over the past two years, DataKind has engaged in work exploring the potential impact of data science and AI in strengthening financial inclusion and economic opportunity. From our partnership with the International Monetary Fund to [tackle big questions on climate and gender](https://www.datakind.org/2023/09/12/tackling-big-questions-on-climate-and-gender-datakind-partners-with-international-monetary-fund-on-virtual-datadive-event/) to launching [three products](https://www.datakind.org/2024/09/27/data-driven-impact-for-financial-inclusion-unveiling-three-datakind-products/) supporting financial inclusion last fall, DataKind is ensuring stakeholders have access to high-quality, up-to-date, and relevant data and data-driven insights to support strategic decision-making and service delivery.

## Problem to tackle
The social sector and its stakeholders face significant challenges when financial inclusion and economic opportunity data are missing or inaccessible. Without comprehensive, high-quality, and timely data, organizations struggle to identify gaps in access to financial services, assess the impact of economic policies, and design interventions that effectively reach underserved communities. Limited data availability—especially disaggregated data by gender, geography, and socioeconomic status—prevents stakeholders from making informed, data-driven decisions, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for meaningful impact.

With this in mind, DataKind aims to grow the breadth and depth of our knowledge in the financial inclusion and economic opportunity sector to support a global suite of stakeholders. Through this DataKit, we’re looking to explore international economic opportunity data and insights to better understand opportunities to leverage publicly available data to support local decision-making and impact. 

#### Tip
Ready to go? Head to the [Challenge](https://github.com/datakind/datakit-financial-inclusion-2025/discussions/1) to dive in. It comes with further details, some initial questions, and guidance for how to get started.

## How to contribute
Join us to deliver insights, understanding, and solutions to explore and address global economic opportunity. As a volunteer, you can contribute to challenges in technical or nontechnical ways, as often as you’d like–there’s something for everyone. Here are some avenues to consider:

### Research
We’re working to capture the most comprehensive picture of economic opportunity. There is a lot of data and information out there -- help us find and evaluate data sources to expand access to key information.

### Data analysis and visualization
Draw connections between datasets to help create a community-level understanding of financial and economic needs in selected countries. Visualize those relationships in interpretable ways so that we can answer key questions.

## Accessing the data
For this challenge, we’ve provided links to some initial datasets to explore by country, but we encourage you to do additional research to identify more sources, as relevant and applicable. We are also open to exploring new countries not yet listed, so feel free to offer suggestions!

## Submitting your work
Every bit of information you contribute is a chance for DataKind to better understand financial inclusion and economic opportunity, and provide data-driven insights to stakeholders in the sector. **We want to see it all** as everything will help–not just right answers, but wrong answers and works in progress too.
